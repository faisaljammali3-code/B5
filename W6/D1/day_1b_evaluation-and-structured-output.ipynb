    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, make sure you have:\n",
    "- Completed `day-1a-prompting.py` (recommended but not required)\n",
    "- Obtained a Gemini API key from [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys)\n",

    "### LLM Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example:\n",
    "- LLMs can struggle with numerical problems (like counting characters in a word)\n",
    "- They may not accurately evaluate tasks that require precise measurements\n",
    "- They can be biased based on their training data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customizing evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behavior that might be better provided from a tool."

    "### Improving Confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to reduce error, except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse."
