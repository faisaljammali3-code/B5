# # Day 1b - Evaluation and Structured Output
#
# This tutorial builds on the prompting techniques from `day-1a-prompting.py` and focuses on evaluating LLM outputs and using structured output formats.
#
# ## Learning Objectives
#
# By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
# - Evaluate LLM outputs using pointwise and pairwise evaluation methods
# - Use structured output formats for programmatic evaluation
# - Understand best practices and limitations of LLM evaluation
# - Build evaluation systems for real-world applications
#
# ## Prerequisites
#
# Before starting, make sure you have:
# - Completed `day-1a-prompting.py` (recommended but not required)
# - Completed the setup instructions in `SETUP.md`
# - Obtained a Gemini API key from [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys)
# - Installed the required dependencies (see `SETUP.md`)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Setup

# %% [markdown]
# ### Import the SDK and Helpers

# %%
from google import genai
from google.genai import types
from IPython.display import HTML, Markdown, display
from google.api_core import retry

# %% [markdown]
# ### Set Up Retry Helper
#
# This allows you to run all cells without worrying about per-minute quota limits.
# The retry helper will automatically retry requests that fail due to rate limiting (429) or service unavailability (503).

# %%
is_retriable = lambda e: (isinstance(e, genai.errors.APIError) and e.code in {429, 503})

genai.models.Models.generate_content = retry.Retry(
    predicate=is_retriable)(genai.models.Models.generate_content)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Initialize the Client
#
# The Gemini API uses a `Client` object to make requests.
# The client handles authentication and lets you control which backend to use (Gemini API or Vertex AI).
#
# **Note:** Make sure you have set up your API key according to the instructions in `SETUP.md`.

# %%
# Initialize the client with your API key
# Replace with your actual API key or use environment variable
import os

api_key = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("Please set GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable. See SETUP.md for instructions.")

client = genai.Client(api_key=api_key)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Part 1: Evaluation and Structured Output
#
# When using LLMs in real-world applications, it's important to understand how well they are performing.
# The open-ended generation capabilities of LLMs can make evaluation challenging.
# This section covers techniques for evaluating LLM outputs.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Document Summarization Example
#
# For this evaluation example, we'll use a document summarization task. First, let's download a sample document and upload it to the Gemini API.

# %%
import urllib.request

# Download a sample PDF (you can replace this with your own document)
pdf_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/pdf/2403.05530.pdf"
pdf_path = "gemini_technical_report.pdf"

urllib.request.urlretrieve(pdf_url, pdf_path)

document_file = client.files.upload(file=pdf_path)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Summarize a Document

# %%
request = 'Tell me about the training process used here.'

def summarise_doc(request: str) -> str:
    """Execute the request on the uploaded document."""
    # Set the temperature low to stabilize the output
    config = types.GenerateContentConfig(temperature=0.0)
    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model='gemini-2.5-flash',
        config=config,
        contents=[request, document_file],
    )
    
    return response.text

summary = summarise_doc(request)
Markdown(summary)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Define an Evaluator
#
# For evaluation tasks, you may wish to assess various aspects:
# - **Instruction following**: How well the model followed the prompt
# - **Groundedness**: Whether the response contains only information from the provided context
# - **Fluency**: How easy the text is to read
# - **Conciseness**: Whether the response is appropriately brief
# - **Quality**: Overall quality of the response
#
# You can instruct an LLM to perform these evaluations similar to how you would instruct a human rater: with a clear definition and assessment rubric.

# %%
import enum

# Define the evaluation prompt
SUMMARY_PROMPT = """\
# Instruction
You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses generated by AI models.
We will provide you with the user input and an AI-generated response.
You should first read the user input carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the response based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.
You will assign the response a rating following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Give step-by-step explanations for your rating, and only choose ratings from the Rating Rubric.

# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
You will be assessing summarization quality, which measures the overall ability to summarize text. Pay special attention to length constraints, such as in X words or in Y sentences. The instruction for performing a summarization task and the context to be summarized are provided in the user prompt. The response should be shorter than the text in the context. The response should not contain information that is not present in the context.

## Criteria
Instruction following: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the summarization task instructions, satisfying all of the instruction's requirements.
Groundedness: The response contains information included only in the context. The response does not reference any outside information.
Conciseness: The response summarizes the relevant details in the original text without a significant loss in key information without being too verbose or terse.
Fluency: The response is well-organized and easy to read.

## Rating Rubric
5: (Very good). The summary follows instructions, is grounded, is concise, and fluent.
4: (Good). The summary follows instructions, is grounded, concise, and fluent.
3: (Ok). The summary mostly follows instructions, is grounded, but is not very concise and is not fluent.
2: (Bad). The summary is grounded, but does not follow the instructions.
1: (Very bad). The summary is not grounded.

## Evaluation Steps
STEP 1: Assess the response in aspects of instruction following, groundedness, conciseness, and verbosity according to the criteria.
STEP 2: Score based on the rubric.

# %% [markdown]
# In this example, the model generated a textual justification in a chat context. This full text response is useful for human interpretation and gives the model a place to "collect notes" while assessing the text. The working "notes" are used when generating the final result output.
#
# In the next turn, the model converts the text output into a structured response. If you want to aggregate scores or use them programmatically, you want to avoid parsing unstructured text. Here the `SummaryRating` schema is passed, so the model converts the chat history into an instance of the `SummaryRating` enum.

# ### Pointwise Evaluation
#
# The technique used above, where you evaluate a single input/output pair against some criteria, is known as **pointwise evaluation**. This is useful for evaluating singular outputs in an absolute sense, such as "was it good or bad?"

# ## Part 2: Best Practices and Limitations
#
# ### LLM Limitations
#
# LLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example:
# - LLMs can struggle with numerical problems (like counting characters in a word)
# - They may not accurately evaluate tasks that require precise measurements
# - They can be biased based on their training data
#
# There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.
#
# One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customizing evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on "internal knowledge" from the model, or behavior that might be better provided from a tool.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Improving Confidence
#
# One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple "opinions" helps to reduce error, except by using different models the "opinions" will be more diverse.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Summary
#
# In this tutorial, you've learned:
#
# 1. **Evaluation Methods**: How to evaluate LLM outputs using pointwise and pairwise evaluation
# 2. **Structured Output**: How to use structured output formats (enums) for programmatic evaluation
# 3. **Evaluation Prompts**: How to design effective evaluation prompts with clear criteria and rubrics
# 4. **Best Practices**: Understanding limitations and improving evaluation confidence
#
# ## Next Steps
#
# - Review `day-1a-prompting.py` if you haven't already, to understand the prompting techniques that generate the outputs you're evaluating
# - Explore the [Gemini API documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs) for more advanced features
# - Check out the [Gemini API cookbook](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook) for more examples
# - Try building your own evaluation system for a specific use case
