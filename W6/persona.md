# Student Persona

The curriculum must be designed assuming the following student background:

1. **Python Week:** Introductory proficiency, including: variables, data types, control flow, functions, classes, and modules. However, they can't analyze a piece of code on their own, or write from scratch without using libraries or frameworks.

2. **ETL with Pandas Week:** Basic data manipulation and syntax, including: reading, writing, filtering, grouping, and transforming data.

3. **ML with Scikit-learn Week:** Basic machine learning models and concepts: tasks (regression, classification), algorithms (linear models, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting), evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score), preprocessing (scaling, encoding, imputation), data splitting strategies (train/test split, k-fold cross-validation) hyperparameter tuning with grid search.

4. **DL with PyTorch Week:** Basic deep learning models and concepts: neural networks, forward and backward propagation, loss functions, optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), regularization (L1, L2), dropout, and transfer learning.

5. **NLP (Statistical & Neural):** Basic NLP concepts: tokenization, vectorization, text classification, information retrieval, topic modeling, and into Neural: Word2Vec, and fine-tuning BERT in PyTorch.
