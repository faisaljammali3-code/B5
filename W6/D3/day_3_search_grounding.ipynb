    "Welcome to the Generative AI Course!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will use [Google Search](https://google.com/) results with the Gemini API in a technique called grounding. This connects the model to verifiable sources of information, allowing it to answer questions about current events or facts that are not in its training data.\n",

    "- A Google Cloud Project with the Gemini API enabled.\n",
    "- An API key stored in the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.\n",
